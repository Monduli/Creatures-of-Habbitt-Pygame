Implement boss fight (generic)
    Allow navigation_gl.py to call match.py with boss context
    Allow for dialog during boss fights
    Allow for boss fight gimmicks
        Flames that fire columns or rows on the beat
            Normal: 1 fire column per 2 beats sometimes 
            Hard: 1 fire column per beat sometimes 
            Headache: Introduce rows, which can blast at the same time as columns and not synced
            Chaos: Rows and columns, 1 per half beat, spontaneous but more common
        Replacing random tiles with non-matching tiles
            Normal: 1 tile per 2 beats

            Headache: 2 tiles per beat
            Chaos: 4 tiles per beat
        Vines that make tiles unmatchable
            Clear a tile next to it to make the vines go away
            Ice alternative
            Difficulty determines how many tiles are blocked by vines/ice per turn

System for voice acting
    Make it generic enough so I can use a sort of
    voice_line(filename)
    Which will take several things into consideration
        Length of voice line
        Presence or absence of existing voice line
        Volume (set in options menu, can be a private variable)
