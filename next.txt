Refactor files 
    Make it so each menu type has its own .py file like equipmentmenu.py does

Multiple save slots

Implement difficulty options in the Options menu
    Smooth, Groovy, Bodacious, Chaos

Remake dungeons
    Replace tiles in tiled with Ally's tilesets when she makes them 

    New 4/24
        Tilemap renders, but it flickers
    New 4/26
        Given up for now, will come back later and try to understand OpenGL better
    New 5/17
        Tilemap still flickers. Does not flicker when it's the only thing rendered.
    New 9/12 (earlier actually)
        Tilemap works without using OpenGL. Will need to port whole thing to Unity.
    New 9/13
        Beginning transfer of project to Godot.
        Not using Unity because of new subscription by downloads model.

Smithing System
    Use items dropped in dungeons to make better weapons / armor

Cooking?
    Through Grilla, combine ingredients dropped in dungeons to make food to buff party
    Can use the same system as smithing, just with food 

Implement boss fight (generic)
    Allow navigation_gl.py to call match.py with boss context
    Allow for dialog during boss fights
    Allow for boss fight gimmicks
        Flames that fire columns or rows on the beat
            Normal: 1 fire column per 2 beats sometimes 
            Hard: 1 fire column per beat sometimes 
            Headache: Introduce rows, which can blast at the same time as columns and not synced
            Chaos: Rows and columns, 1 per half beat, spontaneous but more common
        Replacing random tiles with non-matching tiles
            Normal: 1 tile per 2 beats
            Hard: 1 tile per beat
            Headache: 2 tiles per beat
            Chaos: 4 tiles per beat
        Vines that make tiles unmatchable
            Clear a tile next to it to make the vines go away
            Ice alternative
            Difficulty determines how many tiles are blocked by vines/ice per turn

System for voice acting
    Make it generic enough so I can use a sort of
    voice_line(filename)
    Which will take several things into consideration
        Length of voice line
        Presence or absence of existing voice line
        Volume (set in options menu, can be a private variable)
